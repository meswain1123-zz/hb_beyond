Basic Damage types get more differences between them.
Bludgeoning better (+1 damage) against heavy armor
Piercing better (+1 to hit) against light and medium armor
Slashing better (+1 damage) against unarmored

Base Items get more interesting extra properties.
Whip gets crit on 18-20 for targets at max range.  
(not If they're closer)
Dagger gets crit on 18-20 for melee attacks
(that's part of why rogues love them).
Trident ignores disadvantage on underwater battles.
Spear can do bonus action attack for 1d4 + DEX if used 
for action attack.
etc.

Item materials add extra properties.  
(example: 
Owlbear leather gives -2 stealth check 
but adds cold and fire resistance.)
